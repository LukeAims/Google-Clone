# Google-Clone

For this project I created a clone of google. I did not copy and paste, I styled the page myself by using dev tools to view relevant sizes and colors etc. I uses flexbox to layout the page and added stylings of border, backgrounds, shadows and colors. I used the a tag to link to all the google pages. I also used pseudo elements to add hover styling options to my site. I added the Javascript function of window.open to link to a google search page to add some interactivity to the site. I also added the web speech api to enable dictation when the mic is clicked, along with a form element to create a fully functioning google clone...
